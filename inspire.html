<h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
<p>A hero is someone who demonstrates courage, selflessness, and a commitment to doing what is right, often in the face of danger, hardship, or personal sacrifice. Heroes come in many forms, from those who save lives in perilous situations to individuals who make positive, lasting impacts on their communities.</p>
<p>As a leader of the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, Mandela endured 27 years of imprisonment for his fight against racial segregation and oppression. His unwavering dedication to justice, equality, and forgiveness continues to inspire people around the world including me.</p>
<p>Mandela spent 27 years behind bars, but never gave up his fight for a free South Africe.</p>
